Welcome to RVVDomoticBox's documentation!
=========================================

Welcome to our home automation box project!

The RVVDomoticBox project is led by three engineering students at the
French Engineering School Supelec. It aims at designing a versatile
home automaton manager/box written in Python. Its main characteristics
are the following :

* **open-source**
   We wish that anybody was able to use the base software we developed in order to ensure its continued existence.
* **modularity**
   The whole app is plugin-based, making it really easy to enhance the base system.
* **simplicity**
   The choice of Python as the main programming language of the box and the relative simplicity of the software architecture should allow anyone develop plugins.
